# BJHA-64_Hashing_Algorithm
The BJHA-64 (Bradlet and Jayden's Hashing Algorithm-64 Bit) is a hashing algorithm that I made. It is a okay hashing algorithm but **do not use** in real life (yet). It is very weak in real-life hacking conditions. This hashing algorithm is very good for educational purposes though. 

To use this hashing alg, follow these steps:

  1. Copy/Download the file as text.
  2. Paste algorithm into a python scipt execution environment. Run the algorithm. To customize your password hash, change your input (password) in the 34th line of code, and change the text between the commas. 
  3. When ran, it should show something that says **"Password: Example JHA-64: 5531044AD248B014E2F15C48A7CEG65"**
  4. Then copy the part that comes after the JHA-64:
  5. That is your hash!
