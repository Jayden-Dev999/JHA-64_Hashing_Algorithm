# JHA-64_Hashing_Algorithm
The JHA-64 (Jayden's Hashing Algorithm-64 Bit) is a hashing algorithm that I made. It is a okay hashing algorithm but **do not use** in real life. It is very weak in real-life hacking conditions. This hashing algorithm is very good for educational purposes though. 

To use this hashing alg, follow these steps:

  1. Copy/Download the file as text.
  2. Paste algorithm into a python scipt execution environment. Run the algorithm. Tip: I use the online python executor, Programiz. Programiz not only offer python execution, but also javascript, html, and many more! To use, go to programiz.com, click on python, then on the top bar, click on online compiler. There you go! You're all set.
  3. When ran, it should show something that says **"Password: Example.                      "**
                                                   **JHA-64: 5531044AD248B014E2F15C48A7CEG675**
  5. Then copy the part that comes after the JHA-64:
  6. That is your hash!
